0.  How many differnt colors does each format support?  In their respective standard formats: Windows bitmap (BMP) depends on the number of bits per pixels used in the file (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 24, 32), but the 32-bits per pixel format, which represents 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 distict colors per pixel, in a lossless format; Joint Photographic Expert Group (JPEG) file format support 24-bits, which represents 3^24 = 16,777,216 distinct colors per pixel, in a lossy format.
1.  Which of these formats supports animation? Neither BMP file format or JPEG file format support animation.
2.  What's the difference between lossy and lossless compression? Any type of media file such as music, images or video can be stored in lossy or lossless formats. The files in lossy format usually consume a lot less storage space than files in lossless formats. The differnce between the two formats is storage space, quality of files, and better support for lossy formats. In the case of image management: Images stored in Windows bitmat (BMP) do not suffer from appreciable loss in quality even after prolonged storage. In Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG), however keeps loosing quality even after plolonged storage, and keeps loosing quality with after each save, or edit. This loss is not recoverable. The storage space used by JPEG is incredibly small compared to the size of BMP files, which occupy huge amounts of space even for small files.
3.  Which of these formats is lossy-compressed? JPEG file format is lossy-compressed. 
4.  What happens, techinacally speaking, when a file is deleted on a FAT file system? A File Allocation Table (FAT, FAT12, FAT16, VFAT and FAT32): is a linked list of disk clusters that DOS uses to manage space on a random-access device; it comes in 16 or 32 sector numbers (bit length). A hard disk is always arranged in 512 byte sectors, which are grouped into clusters. A cluster is either: Part of a file, and points to the next cluster of that file; The last cluster in a file, and thus holds a special (EOF); Free and thus zero; Marked defective. Basically, the FAT is a linked list of clusters that correspond to files. Essentially, when you request to delete a file two things occur: First, the system modifies the file by changing the first character in the file's directory to signal that it has been deleted and can be rewritten. Secondly, the system moves the files clusters to the hard drive's list of free clusters. Basically, the actual data is never deleted. The table simply marks the clusters as free, and sooner or late,r they are written over.  
5.  What can someone like you do to ensure (with hight probability) that files you delete cannot be recovered?
6.  What's stdint.h?
7.  What's the point of using unit_8, unit32_t, int32_t, and unit16_t in program?
8.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively? (Assume a 32-bit architecture like the CS50 Appliance.)
9.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? (Leading bytes used to identify file formats (with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers").
10. What's the difference between bfSize and biSize?
11. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
12. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP's color depth (i.e. bits per pixel)?
13. Why might fopwn return NULL in copy.c:37?
14. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
15. What value does copy.c:70 assign padding if bi.Width is 3?
16. What does fseek do?
17. What is SEEK_CUR?
18. Whodunit?
