Repository is holds solutions to the CS50 Problem Sets. Introduction to Computer Science I, Harvard College.


#### CS50 Course Description:####

Computer Science 50 (otherwise known as CS50) is Harvard College's introductory course for majors and non-majors alike, a one-semester amalgam of courses generally known as CS1 and CS2 taught mostly in C.

Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, encapsulation, data structures, databases, memory management, security, software development, virtualization, and websites. Languages include C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience.

Even if you are not a student at Harvard, you are welcome to "take" this course via cs50.tv by following along via the Internet. (The course's own website is at www.cs50.net.) Available at right are videos of lectures, sections (aka "recitations" or "precepts"), and seminars along with PDFs of all handouts. Also available at right are the course's problem sets and quizzes. If you have questions or would like to discuss the material with others, do join the course's Google Group.

#### Problem Sets ####

Nine problem sets are assigned during the year. Each is due via electronic submission anytime before 31 December 2014.

In order to accommodate students with different backgrounds, some problem sets are released in two editions: a standard edition intended for most students and a "Hacker Edition" intended for some students. Both editions essentially cover the same material. But the Hacker Edition typically presents that material from a more technical angle and poses more sophisticated questions. 

* Problem Set 0: Scratch
* Problem Set 1: C
* Problem Set 2: Crypto
* Problem Set 3: Game of Fifteen
* Problem Set 4: Breakout
* Problem Set 5: Forensics
* Problem Set 6: Mispellings
* Problem Set 7: C$50 Finance 
* Problem Set 8: CS50 Shuttle
